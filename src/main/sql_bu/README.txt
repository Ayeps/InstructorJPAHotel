IMPORTANT SETUP INFORMATION:
===========================

To use this sample program you need to first restore the "hotels"
database (MySql) using the enclosed backup .sql file.

The database has tables for building security into the app, but in this 
demo app these tables are not being used. A separate, secured version of this 
app is available as a separate project.

TIP: when stopping, then starting Glassfish, first do a "CLEAN", followed by
a "CLEAN and BUILD" before running the app again.
